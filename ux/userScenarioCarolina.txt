- Leticia's Scenario - Persona: Carolina
    
    Today Carolina works remotely in the late shift till 12 am and has only one hour lunch at 7 pm. She has already prepared pasta and chicken yesterday and have them in airtight containers in the fridge. Nevertheless, she ate pasta with chicken yesterday and doesn't want to eat this dish again. 
    She has other ingredients to cook another dish but doesn't want to use half of her lunch time cooking. In this situation, she remembers that HappyCook can help her to look for quicker recipe options in order to improvise another dish. 
    As she is using her laptop to work, she opens the webapp in a browser, checks what she has in the fridge, keeps in her mind what she wants to eat, goes back to her laptop and enters the ingredients on the search bar. She types: pasta, cheese, tomato and gets a list with the quickest recipes according to these three ingredients. 
    The most suitable one is "Pasta with Fresh Tomatoes and Corn" so she clicks on the recipe overview, reads what ingredients she needs and since has almost all ingredients, she decides on preparing this. It takes her 15 minutes as she had already cooked pasta yesterday, and eats it in 15 minutes. She has 30 minutes to relax and talk with her friends.
