    L: First, I'm gonna ask you some personal questions. What's your name?
    
    C: My name is Carolina.
    
    L: What do you do?
    
    C: I'm a translator and interpreter.
    
    L: What's your current living situation?
    
    C: I live alone, work and am self-reliant.
    
    L: Where do you live?
    
    C: I live in Lisbon, Portugal.
    
    L: How old are you?
    
    C: I'm 29 years old.
    
    L: Do you use social media?
    
    C: Yes, I do.
    
    L: Which are the ones you use the most?
    
    C: Facebook and Instagram, and to be honest these are the only ones that I have. For example, I don't use TikTok... ah I forgot I have Twitter. So the order goes: Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
    
    L: Regarding food, what is your favorite food or meal?
    
    C: Favorite food... I like any dish that includes cheese. So this topic can be very broad, it can be lasagna, cheese chupe, cheese turnovers, and so on.
    
    L: Do you prepare these kind of dishes at home, for example cheese chupe or pizza? Or do you avoid it?
    
    C: Yes, I do prepare these dishes. I prepare them because I like them. And dishes that sometimes are not easy to buy, I have to cook them by myself.
    
    L: And if you have the option between going out and eat these dishes in a restaurant or cooking them and eating them at home, what do you prefer?
    
    C: If it's about a pizza, sometimes I prefer to eat it outside but if it's cheese chupe or cheese turnovers, food that I can't get easily here since don't belong to this culture, I prepare them by myself.
    
    L: How often do you cook in a week?
    
    C: In a week, I think I cook twice. But when I cook, I cook big portions for 7 days a week.
    
    L: Why do you cook at home?
    
    C: Because it's cheaper than eating outside. That's the first reason. The second one is due to pandemics, I don't go out so often. Usually I don't visit restaurants in lunch and dinner time. I used to do it with friends before the pandemic. Then, because of a matter of time and because for me cooking at home is quicker than going out and eating in a restaurant. At home it takes me 15-20 minutes to cook something. And because I know that I'm going to cook dishes that I like. So if someone asks me to eat out and eat in another house, and they have seafood; maybe I'd feel a little bit uncomfortable since that's something that I don't really fancy.
    
    L: Do you have any allergies or dietary restrictions?
    
    C: No, I don't.
    
    L: How long do you spend in cooking a meal?
    
    C: In general, I think the average is 30 minutes or 25 minutes. I have never ever spent the whole afternoon cooking, like roasting a turkey. I avoid long cooking preparations, I like more practical dishes.
    
    L: If you have any interest, how do you learn cooking new dishes?
    
    C: Searching first in Google on a recipe website. Once for example, I was looking for a very specific recipe. So I look how to cook corn pie. Corn Pie is a traditional dish of a certain culture, in this case Chile so I cannot buy it in the market, the best option to prepare it by oneself. It is very traditional, then I searched for the recipe on internet. And I landed on a YouTube channel of a Chilean chef, who prepares the dish and... I watched many videos on this search, but I found one that caught my eye and saw that he had a YouTube channel and it was very practical with many recipes and showing a vast experience. From there, I started following this chef on Instagram. So this helped me to get more knowledge about him. So if I don't know how to prepare a dish, I do a search on Google, after I see who are references in this area and follow them in social media.
    
    L: So you searched on Google and then landed on YouTube. On YouTube, you mentioned that the learning way shown in this channel was practical, which features or aspects of this channel made you think that this is practical in comparison to other websites?
    
    C: I watched several videos before deciding on this. This channel features direct speech, simple language, clear instructions and another important things in food are quantities and time. He explained clearly, for example: 150 g butter times half kilogram sugar, knead and give shape during five minutes with circular movements, etc. That was simple, direct, clear, he didn't employ too much time explaining as other YouTube channels which makes you wait till the end to know the recipe. Other channels give long introductions and after fifteen or twenty minutes of video, you still don't know the measures of ingredients to cook. This chef instead doesn't do that. He presents the ingredients, then measures, speaks a little bit about the history of the dish, origin and explanation, and after cooking instructions. It caught my eye as well that since cooking is something practical, he recorded step by step not like other chefs who have already made some preparations in advance, like dough. This chef cooks in real time, so for example he started a Chilean stew from the first step, chopping the beef, then frying the onions, peel the potatoes, and after 25 minutes he had served the dish. And another option that I liked is that for example, he says that you need 150 g wheat flour but if it happens that you only have oat flour, you can use it. His recipes are not restricted, he gives you substitutes. I liked the flexibility. Since you're not going to buy 1 kg almond flour for a one-time preparation, he gives you the substitutes you can find at home. And the guy is charming, so he's someone I can listen to, not boring, talks about the relation about family and food. He speaks about his childhood, and says the aromas evoke memories of his grandmother. In fact, food in some way is that, we cook some dish because we like it and it brings back memories. So I feel connected.
    
    L: So I have the impression that you prepare these recipes because you want to feel or try a taste you miss, which is connected to a feeling. I mean this is something you don't do everyday, for example when you cook twice for the entire week.
    
    C: No. Indeed I can explain the difference between two situations. For example, you asked me what I do when I don't know how to cook a dish. When I want to prepare something specific like one of the recipes I mentioned before, I look up for them in this channel and these dishes are not going to be for my everyday meal plan. But this method is applicable for other dishes, such as a different salad, or how to mix ingredients, or if I have a piece of beef how to cook it. I search for this info on YouTube. The chef I found it searching for specific recipes but I have used it to cook everyday meals as well. 
    
    L: You mentioned that he has an Instagram account. What kind of information he shares in this platform?
    
    C: He shares several things, first for example, ingredients such a tomato. He posts a photo of a tomato, not of any tomato, but of a pomodoro tomato. So he explains what you can do with it, such as a tomato sauce. One day he posted a Chilean papaya.
    Second, he shares photos, videos, reels and lives of recipes. Currently, he works in a TV show so sometimes he posts some videos about it.
    He also posts his work as a volunteer for a charity organized by chefs called "Chefs for Chile", where they prepare communal pots for impoverished people.
    
    L: So the YouTube channel has only recipes.
    
    C: That's right.
    
    L: Apart from these days when you cook a special dish, do you use recipes? or do you have some notes like measures about a dish?
    
    C: No, I don't and I don't have notes either. I look up for ideas based on the ingredients I have at home. Regarding measures, I measure with the naked eye.
    
    L: How do you search for these recipes based on ingredients?
    
    C: I always use Google, enter the ingredients. Usually I enter "recipes" and the ingredients. Indeed, I have an eggplant in my fridge. So I'll enter "recipes with eggplant" and as I don't have oven in my new apartment I wrote at the end "without oven". The search was not completely accurate since Google didn't read "without" and all the recipes I got had "oven". Some dishes were: roasted eggplant, eggplant fricassee, filled eggplant.
    It caught my eye that most of the recommended websites or first in the list are always the same. There is one website called "Cookpad", and I've never taken the time to read it but I always see the logo and the color of the visited link.
    Sometimes I enter "what to do with" and the ingredient.
    
    L: You say that you visit the first websites in the search engine, so you choose one of these first websites.
    
    C: I consult the first websites but are not the ones I always choose. For example, when I look up for eggplant recipes and the first option mentions "oven". So I don't choose this since I don't have an oven, and I search for it in another website till I find most suitable option.
    
    L: I understand. You choose one website from the ones the search engine recommends and you don't go to a specific website that you like.
    Which device(s) do you use to look up recipes?
    
    C: Laptop or cellphone.
    
    L: What browser do you use?
    
    C: Google.
    
    L: Is there any cooking website that you didn't have a good experience with?
    
    C: There is one but I don't remember the name. I remember how it looked. For example, there were low-quality images. There were photos of a hot plate with steam so you couldn't clearly see the dish. I had a bad impression, I didn't like the recipe presentation at all. Although the recipe was well explained, the visual presentation made a bad impression, like a neglected website. Therefore, I didn't visit it anymore.
    And the same applies to super produced photos. I have the same feeling when you compare a BigMac from a poster with a real one, I feel disappointed. I prefer close-to-reality pictures as I'm gonna to prepare a certain dish at home and if it doesn't look like the super-produced photos, I could feel frustrated. There must be a balance between reality and good quality, not exaggerated.
    
    L: When you search for recipes, what aspects are relevant to you? 
    
    C: Time. If the recipe takes one hour, I ignore it. I don't have one hour to cook. I live alone and cooking doesn't give me pleasure as it gives another people. I cook because I have to. And when I don't know what to cook I search for recipes as I mentioned.
    
    Kitchen utensils,ingredients are important as well. The recipe must be simple and practical. Some of the key words I use for searching are: "easy recipe", "quick recipe".
    
    L: Have you ever used a cooking-related app?
    
    C: No, I haven't, and I don't know any.
    
    L: Do you have interest in using one?
    
    C: I think I'll be interested. In my Google search I haven't seen any app. Sometimes Google Play makes recommendations.
    If I know that I'm going to find everything I need in one app: real photos, well-explained recipes, measures, I'd happy to use it instead of Google.
    
    L: Have you experienced finding several recipes for the same dish but the difference between them are the user ratings? 
    
    C: Yes.
    
    L: Does these ratings have an influence in your decision?
    
    C: No, not at all. If there is a recipe with one star and satisfies my needs, I will choose this one. Because it'll be my preparation. It'd be another story if we speak about a delivery food app, where you can see restaurant's ratings and users' comments and that's relevant to me. My criteria is more important and then other users' ratings or comments.
    
    L: Sometimes it appears the quantity of people, who made the recipe. Is this relevant to you?
    
    C. You mean this "10 people have cooked this dish". No, it isn't relevant.
    
    L: If you could develop an app, what would you like to see in it that you haven't seen in another websites?
    
    C: Ingredient substitutes. Most of the recipes are very limited. For example, potato puree with one kind of potato but no sweet potato or red potato, etc. Another idea will be to have recipes with dietary restriction equivalents: gluten-free, lactose-free, etc.
    
    L: Have you thrown away groceries because you didn't know what to cook them with?
    
    C: Yes, I have.
    
    L: Have you thrown away food because you cooked more than you needed?
    
    C: Yes, I have.
    
    L: Do you think that if you calculate the correct portions when cooking, you could reduce your household food waste?
    
    C: Yes, of course.
    
    L: How do you feel about your meal routine? You mentioned that you eat the same dish several days a week. 
    
    C: From my point of view, it's practical. I cook one many dishes which I interchange them. For example: I cook pasta, sausages, chicken, beef and during the week I make pairs: pasta with sausage, pasta with chicken, and so on. Even I repeat my favorite dishes without a problem, such as chickpeas. I'm satisfied. I have one hour lunch time, so I can take the airtight container from the fridge and heat the dish in a microwave for 2 minutes and done. If I cook everyday, I'd have to spend 30 minutes only cooking. This works for lunch and dinner time, I can interchange dishes in the same day. At the beginning, I used to cook everyday but as I was getting busier I changed my routine. And as I'm alone, I don't have any problem with eating precooked food. I save time and electric power too. My electric stove takes a long time to heat and every time I turn it on, at the beginning it consumes so much power. After preparing one dish, is already hot so I can cook faster. I save money as well.
    
    L: Do you use microwave to cook?
    
    C: Not so often. Only for mug cakes.
